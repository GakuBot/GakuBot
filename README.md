## What is GakuBot?

GakuBot is an experimental machine learning game.
This game simulates two players both trying to get to the same target. The winner is the first player to reach the target.
This game has several different versions, which are really just different ways of training the AI to learn how to play the game.
The aim of the game is for both yourself and the AI to learn how to play, and to observe how the AI learns the game.
